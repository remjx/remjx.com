When I tried to push my git branch to remote, I was getting this error:

```
$     git push --set-upstream origin my-branch
Enumerating objects: 845, done.
Counting objects: 100% (845/845), done.

client_loop: send disconnect: Connection reset by peer
fatal: the remote end hung up unexpectedly
```

It looks like a connection issue, but that was not the case at all.

The fix was simple: do a `git pull` to merge changes with remote. Then push again.

That was easy.
