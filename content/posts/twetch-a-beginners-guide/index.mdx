## What is Twetch?

[Twetch](https://twetch.app) is a decentralized social media platform built on Bitcoin SV. Launched in 2019, Twetch looks and feels just like Twitter, with some important differences that make it a compelling alternative.

## What is Bitcoin SV?

[Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/) (BSV) is the blockchain and currency used by Twetch.

![Bitcoin SV Logo](./bitcoin-sv-logo.jpg)

Bitcoin SV is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whose primary differentiator is an unlimited block size. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have fixed block size limits (1MB and 32MB respectively), Bitcoin SV (BSV) removes the limit entirely, leaving the decision to individual miners. This enables low-fee microtransactions and makes it practical to host data on-chain, as we shall see below when we learn how Twetch works.

The existence of different forks (versions) of Bitcoin is the result of civil wars between factions of bitcoin users who disagree on what the protocol rules should be.

In my opinion, all forks of bitcoin are bitcoin and it is wise to keep ownership parity across all bitcoin forks (BTC, BCH, BSV). Nobody knows for sure which will succeed or fail. It is possible they all succeed, gaining adoption & value over time, just being used for different purposes by different groups of people. BTC is branded as digital gold, BCH is branded as digital cash with a focus on retail adoption, and BSV is branded as digital cash with a focus on supporting digital enterprises with on-chain data.

## How is Twetch different from Twitter?

### Posts live forever on the blockchain

For every user interaction on Twetch, a BSV transaction is created under the hood. This means all interactions are public, timestamped, and immutable (meaning they cannot be altered or deleted).

From a user perspective, it looks like you're transacting in dollars and cents (or whatever your local currency is). In other words, it uses the exchange rate to display amounts in your local currency to make it more intuitive.

In this decentralized model where user data exists on a public blockchain, an interesting property exists: the data layer and the app layer are separate. The app is simply a private viewing window into the public data. Unlike Twitter, where only Twitter has an up-to-date copy of all its user data, Twetch pulls its user data from the public blockchain.

This separation encourages competiton and reduces the monopolistic network effects existent in current social media establishments. If Twetch implements a policy its users don't like (e.g. censoring posts, banning users), the user data is still publicly available. This means anyone can create a fork (a new version of Twetch) that leverages all the public data without implementing those disagreeable business policies. Under the current centralized models of Twitter and Facebook, if you don't like what they are doing with user data, your only option is to leave.

> Note: Not _all_ your Twetch data exists on the blockchain. For example your profile photo only exists on their servers. The benefit of this is you can change it for free without incurring any cost. The downside is the same as the centralized model: it lacks data portability. Hopefully this is only temporary.

### Pay-to-post and earn money when users engage with your content

Posting on Twetch is not free because you are creating a Bitcoin transaction under the hood, and to prevent spam, miners require a small fee to process a transaction. On BSV, these fees are small and practically negligible (a small fraction of a cent).

On the upside, you have the opportunity to earn profit from each post. Any time another user interacts with your content, you earn a commission.

- Creating a post costs 2¢ (X% goes to Twetch)
- Liking a post costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Branching (the equivalent of Retweeting) costs 3¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Following a user costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Someone mentions you (X% goes to you)

Twetch earns a small (~10%) commission on the user-to-user interactions, while the other 90% goes to the user.

### Encrypted chat

- It has an encrypted chat feature so 

(insert table comparison of Twetch vs Twitter)

Since all posts are public on the blockchain, the Twetch app itself is just a "window" into the blockchain and has some additional functionalities built on top of the "base layer" of public posts.

Some members of the Twetch team are intentional trolls. They threaten to ban people from the platform. They post memes. They taunt Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But there is a subtle signal they are sending by doing this sort of thing. Even if you develop a distaste for them, or don't trust them, the beauty is that you can fork their project at any time by leveraging the data that is on the blockchain. In other words, if the Twetch community decided that the Twetch founders were being toxic, nobody can stop you from creating your own version of Twetch that doesn't engage in these types of toxic practices. In other words, Twetch is anti-fragile because unlike Twitter, all the data is public.

### Your @username is a number and can't be changed

But you can change your display name anytime, and people will be able to search for your display name when they type '@'.

Your number is simply determined by incrementing from the current number of existing Twetch users. If there are 20,000 users when you sign up, your u/ number will be @20001.

This means there is a little "street cred" bonus for early adopters who have a low u/ number.

Your permanent username is incremental based on the number of Twetch users that existed before you signed up. I'm @4652 which means I was the 4,652nd person to sign up.
- Although your u/ name is permanent, you can set a display name just like Twitter

## Developer API

Developers can use the official [twetch-js](https://github.com/twetch-inc/twetch-js) package to create interactions programmatically.

The most interesting application I've found so far is [Windbell](https://windbell.app/) which allows you to convert any Twitter public profile into a Twetch bot that copies all the user's tweets to Twetch. Anybody can contribute money to the Windbell to keep it up and running (since it costs 2 cents to post a Twetch). And a cool bonus is that the creator of the Windbell earns money on any interactions with it.

## How to sign up

Twetch is currently invite only, but there are ways you can get in. Currently on [Twetch's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/twetchapp) the website in the profile is a link to an invite. Existing users can invite new users, and have some extra invites. <a href={links.myTwitter}>DM me on Twitter</a> if you need one. As a last resort, you can sign up on the public waitlist on their website, [twetch.app](https://twetch.app).

Signing up is pretty straightforward using the invite link. It's basically a two-step process:
1. Create and fund a supported BSV wallet (MoneyButton, RelayX, DotWallet)
2. Accept your invite and link your Twetch account to your wallet account
3. (Optional) Follow me! I'm [@4652](https://twetch.app/u/4652) on Twetch.

## Memes

The Twetch and BSV community are relatively small right now, so a lot of the memes being posted are Bitcoin related. Here are some to be on the lookout for:

- Craig Wright 

## Meet The Founders

Twetch is operated by a dissident team of Bitcoin SV enthusiasts. Headed by Josh Petty, CEO and self-proclaimed "Meme Theory PhD", whose online persona is a Frog by the name of Elon Moist, they have a modest sized team working on the app.

Some of the early team members include:
