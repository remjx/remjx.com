## What is Twetch?

[Twetch](https://twetch.app) is a decentralized social media network built on Bitcoin SV. Launched in 2019, Twetch looks and feels just like Twitter, with some important differences that make it a compelling alternative. The killer feature? **You earn money any time someone interacts with your content**.

## What is Bitcoin SV?

You can skip this section and come back to it, as Bitcoin SV works mostly under the hood, but it's good background information to be aware of.

[Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/) (BSV) is the blockchain and currency used by Twetch.

Bitcoin SV is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whose primary differentiator is its unlimited block size. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have fixed block size limits (1MB and 32MB respectively), Bitcoin SV (BSV) removes the limit entirely, leaving the decision to individual miners. This enables low-fee microtransactions and makes it practical to host data on-chain, as we shall see when we learn how Twetch works.

The other main differentiator is the Bitcoin SV development team's commitment to creating a fixed, stable, base-layer protocol that is "set in stone". Rather than continually adding new features, Bitcoin SV aims for an unchanging, reliable protocol  which has been proven to cause adoption issues in system maintenance.

The existence of these different forks, or versions, of Bitcoin was essentially the result of digital civil wars between factions of bitcoin users who disagreed on what the protocol rules should be.

> My opinion: all forks of Bitcoin are Bitcoin and it is wise to keep ownership parity across all Bitcoin forks (BTC, BCH, BSV). Nobody knows for sure which will succeed or fail. It is possible they all succeed, gaining adoption & value over time, but being used for different purposes by different groups of people. I see BTC as digital gold, BCH as digital cash with a focus on retail adoption, and BSV as digital cash with a focus on enterprise adoption.

## How is Twetch different from Twitter?

### Posts live forever on the blockchain

Every user interaction on Twetch is a BSV transaction under the hood. This means everything is public, timestamped, and immutable. Posts cannot be altered or deleted, so be careful!

In this decentralized model where user data exists on a public blockchain, the data layer and the app layer are totally separate. The app simply provides a private viewing window and interaction capabilities with the public data. Unlike Twitter, where only Twitter has an up-to-date copy of all its user data, Twetch pulls its user data from the public blockchain.

This separation of data from application encourages competition and reduces the monopolistic network effects existent in current social media establishments. If Twetch implements a policy its users don't like (e.g. censoring posts, banning users), the user data is still publicly available. This means anyone can create a fork (a new version of Twetch) that leverages all the public data without implementing those disagreeable business policies. Under the current centralized models of Twitter and Facebook, if you don't like what they are doing with user data, your only option is to leave.

> Note: Not _all_ your Twetch data exists on the blockchain. For example your profile photo only exists on their servers. The benefit of this is you can change it for free without incurring any cost. The downside is the same as the centralized model: it lacks data portability. Hopefully this is only temporary.

### Pay-to-post and earn money when users engage with your content

Posting on Twetch is not free because you are creating a Bitcoin transaction under the hood, and to prevent spam, miners require a small fee to process a transaction. On BSV, these fees are small and practically negligible (a small fraction of a cent).

From a user perspective, although you're transacting in BSV, it _looks_ like you're transacting in dollars and cents (or whatever your local currency is). The user interface uses the exchange rate to display BSV amounts in your local currency to make it more intuitive.

On the upside, you have the opportunity to earn profit from each post. Any time another user interacts with your content, you earn a commission.

- Creating a post costs 2¢ (X% goes to Twetch)
- Liking a post costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Branching (the equivalent of Retweeting) costs 3¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Following a user costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Someone mentions you (X% goes to you)

Twetch earns a small (~10%) commission on the user-to-user interactions, while the other 90% goes to the user.

[Insert chart of current fees by action]

Some members of the Twetch team are intentional trolls. They threaten to ban people from the platform. They post memes. They taunt Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But there is a subtle signal they are sending by doing this sort of thing. Even if you develop a distaste for them, or don't trust them, the beauty is that you can fork their project at any time by leveraging the data that is on the blockchain. In other words, if the Twetch community decided that the Twetch founders were being toxic, nobody can stop you from creating your own version of Twetch that doesn't engage in these types of toxic practices. In other words, Twetch is anti-fragile because unlike Twitter, all the data is public.

### Your @username is a number and can't be changed

But you can change your display name anytime, and people will be able to search for your display name when they type '@'.

Your number is simply determined by incrementing from the current number of existing Twetch users. If there are 20,000 users when you sign up, your u/ number will be @20001.

This means there is a little "street cred" bonus for early adopters who have a low u/ number.

Your permanent username is incremental based on the number of Twetch users that existed before you signed up. I'm @4652 which means I was the 4,652nd person to sign up.
- Although your u/ name is permanent, you can set a display name just like Twitter

### Trigger /actions in posts

- Type "/pay @user $amount" to pay a user directly from your BSV wallet
- Type "/trolltoll @user $amount" to prevent a user from interacting with you unless they pay the "troll toll". Type "/trolltoll remove @user" to remove it.

### Encrypted direct messages

Chat privately "fren2fren" with encrypted messaging. There is a one-time fee of $9.99 to unlock the ability to initiate chats, but after that there are no limits on number of chats or number of messages within a chat. If someone else initiates the chat, it's free. 

Check out [this article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockchain-based-twitter-competitor-twetch-releases-encrypted-chat-app/) for more information how it works at a technical level.

## Developer API

Developers can use the official [twetch-js](https://github.com/twetch-inc/twetch-js) package to create interactions programmatically.

[Windbell](https://windbell.app/) is an app utilizing the API which allows you to convert any Twitter public profile into a Twetch bot. Simply select the Twitter @username, pay $2.18 to initialize the bot, and those funds will be used to create new Twetch posts any time that Twitter user posts a new tweet. Anybody can contribute money to the Windbell fund to keep the bot up and running (since it costs 2 cents to post on Twetch). And a cool bonus is that the creator of the Windbell earns money on any interactions with the bot. Here is an example Windbell I created: [Tim Ferriss Bot](https://twetch.app/u/17108). 

## How to sign up

Twetch is currently invite only, but there are ways you can get in. Currently on [Twetch's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/twetchapp) the website in the profile is a link to an invite. Existing users can invite new users, and have some extra invites. <a href={links.myTwitter}>DM me on Twitter</a> if you need one. As a last resort, you can sign up on the public waitlist on their website, [twetch.app](https://twetch.app).

Signing up is pretty straightforward using the invite link. It's basically a two-step process:
1. Create and fund a supported BSV wallet (MoneyButton, RelayX, DotWallet)
2. Accept your invite and link your Twetch account to your wallet account
3. (Optional) Follow me! I'm [@4652](https://twetch.app/u/4652) on Twetch.

## How shuould I use Twetch? 

- Use it just like Twitter. But be careful what you post since all your posts will live on the blockchain forever.
- Post memes. Josh Petty, the CEO of Twetch, said his team likes to think of Twetch as a "marketplace for memes"[^marketplace-for-memes].
- Build a following any way you can.

## Meet The Founders

Twetch is operated by a dissident team of Bitcoin SV enthusiasts. Headed by Josh Petty, CEO and self-proclaimed "Meme Theory PhD", whose online persona is a Frog by the name of Elon Moist, they have a modest sized team working on the app.

Some of the early team members include:

- @1
- @2
