<h2 id="what-is-twetch">What is Twetch?</h2>

[Twetch](https://twetch.app) is a decentralized social media network running on Bitcoin SV. Launched in February 2019, Twetch looks and feels like Twitter, but with some important differences that make it a compelling alternative. The killer feature? **You earn money every time someone interacts with your content!** 🤑

<h2 id="what-is-bitcoin-sv">What is Bitcoin SV?</h2>

This section is not required reading, as Bitcoin SV works under the hood and is mostly invisible to the user. However, Twetch will make more sense if you understand it within the context of Bitcoin.

[Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/) (BSV) is the blockchain and currency used by Twetch.

Bitcoin SV is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whose primary differentiator is its unlimited block size. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have fixed block size limits (1MB and 32MB respectively), Bitcoin SV (BSV) removes the limit entirely.

With an unlimited block size, it is possible for users to make low-fee "microtransactions" (fractions of a cent) and host data on-chain. Twetch utilizes these capabilities, as we shall see.

What's wrong with Twitter? Why use Twetch?

### Posts live forever on the blockchain ♾️

Every user interaction on Twetch is a BSV transaction under the hood. This means everything is public, timestamped, and immutable.

In this decentralized model where user data exists on a public blockchain, the data layer and the app layer are totally separate. The app simply provides a private viewing window and interaction capabilities with the public data. Unlike Twitter, where only Twitter has an up-to-date copy of all its user data, Twetch pulls its user data from the public blockchain.

This separation of data from application encourages competition and reduces the monopolistic network effects existent in current social media establishments. If Twetch implements a policy its users don't like (e.g. censoring posts, banning users), the user data is still publicly available. This means anyone can leverage all the public data and create their own version of Twetch that doesn't implement those disagreeable business policies. In comparison, under the current centralized models of Twitter and Facebook, if you don't like their policies, your only option is to leave.

> Note: As of the time of writing, not _all_ your Twetch data exists on the blockchain. For example, your profile photo and display name only exist on the Twetch servers. The benefit of this is you can change it for free without incurring any cost. The downside is the same as the centralized model: it lacks data portability. Hopefully Twetch will move all user data to the blockchain in the future.

### Pay-to-post means higher signal-to-noise ratio 📡

### Earn money when users engage with your content 🤑

Posting on Twetch is not free because you are creating a Bitcoin transaction under the hood, and to prevent spam, miners require a small fee to process a transaction. On BSV, these fees are small and practically negligible (a small fraction of a cent).

From a user perspective, although you're transacting in BSV, it _looks_ like you're transacting in dollars and cents (or whatever your local currency is). The user interface uses the exchange rate to display BSV amounts in your local currency to make it more intuitive.

On the upside, you have the opportunity to earn profit from each post. Any time another user interacts with your content, you earn a commission.

- Creating a post costs 2¢ (X% goes to Twetch)
- Liking a post costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Branching (the equivalent of Retweeting) costs 3¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Following a user costs 10¢ (X% goes to author, X% goes to Twetch)
- Someone mentions you (X% goes to you)

Twetch earns a small (~10%) commission on the user-to-user interactions, while the other 90% goes to the user.

[Insert chart of current fees by action]

Some members of the Twetch team are intentional trolls. They threaten to ban people from the platform. They post memes. They taunt Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But there is a subtle signal they are sending by doing this sort of thing. Even if you develop a distaste for them, or don't trust them, the beauty is that you can fork their project at any time by leveraging the data that is on the blockchain. In other words, if the Twetch community decided that the Twetch founders were being toxic, nobody can stop you from creating your own version of Twetch that doesn't engage in these types of toxic practices. In other words, Twetch is anti-fragile because unlike Twitter, all the data is public.

### Your @username is a number and can't be changed

But you can change your display name anytime, and people will be able to search for your display name when they type '@'.

Your number is simply determined by incrementing from the current number of existing Twetch users. If there are 20,000 users when you sign up, your u/ number will be @20001.

This means there is a little "street cred" bonus for early adopters who have a low u/ number.

Your permanent username is incremental based on the number of Twetch users that existed before you signed up. I'm @4652 which means I was the 4,652nd person to sign up.
- Although your u/ name is permanent, you can set a display name just like Twitter

### Trigger /actions in posts

- Type "/pay @user $amount" to pay a user directly from your BSV wallet
- Type "/trolltoll @user $amount" to prevent a user from interacting with you unless they pay the "troll toll". Type "/trolltoll remove @user" to remove it.

### Encrypted direct messages

Chat privately "fren2fren" with encrypted messaging. There is a one-time fee of $9.99 to unlock the ability to initiate chats, but after that there are no limits on number of chats or number of messages within a chat. If someone else initiates the chat, it's free. 

Check out [this article](https://www.zdnet.com/article/blockchain-based-twitter-competitor-twetch-releases-encrypted-chat-app/) for more information how it works at a technical level.

## Developer API

Developers can use the official [twetch-js](https://github.com/twetch-inc/twetch-js) package to create interactions programmatically.

An example of the API being applied is [Windbell](https://windbell.app/), which allows you to create Twetch bot from any public Twitter account. Simply select the Twitter @username, pay $2.18 to initialize the bot, and those funds will be used to create new Twetch posts any time that Twitter user posts a new tweet. Anybody can contribute money to the Windbell fund to keep the bot up and running (since it costs 2 cents to post on Twetch). And a cool bonus is that the creator of the Windbell earns money on any interactions with the bot. Here is an example Windbell I created: [Tim Ferriss Bot](https://twetch.app/u/17108). 

## Getting Started

### Signing up

Twetch is currently invite only, but there are multiple ways you can get in:

- Click the invite link on [Twetch's Twitter profile](https://twitter.com/twetchapp)
- Ask for an invite from an existing user. I have some extra invites: <a href={links.myTwitter}>DM me on Twitter</a> if you need one.
- Sign up on the public waitlist on their website, [twetch.app](https://twetch.app).

Once you click the invite link, signing up is pretty straightforward. It's basically a two-step process:
1. Create and fund a supported Bitcoin SV wallet ([MoneyButton](https://www.moneybutton.com/money), [RelayX](https://www.relayx.com/), or [DotWallet](https://www.dotwallet.com/en/))
2. Accept your invite and link your Twetch account to your wallet account

## I'm in! Now what?

- Follow me! I'm [@4652](https://twetch.app/u/4652) on Twetch.
