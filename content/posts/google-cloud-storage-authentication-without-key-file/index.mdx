Google has instructions on how to [authenticate with a service account](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production), but the current documentation only explains how to do it with a key file. Is there any way to authenticate using the more familiar method of using project environment variables? Yes!

## The recommended way to authenticate

The Google Cloud docs recommend [downloading your service account key as a JSON file](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/production#create_service_account) and either setting the file path in a system-level environment variable or passing the filename into the instantiation of the Google Cloud class you are using. 

However rather than assuming a key file will exist in some location on the server, I think it is a cleaner solution to set the credentials as environment variables and explicitly reference them in the code.

Not to mention I couldn't get this "recommended" method to work ðŸ™„. I was getting the following errors:

```
ERROR: Error: Could not load the default credentials. Browse to https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started for more information.
```

## The alternative way to authenticate 

Thankfully the alternative is quite simple (although not well documented):

Open the service account JSON credentials file and grab the following: `project_id`, `client_email`, and `private_key`.

Set them as project environment variables (I'm using Next.js's [.env.local](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/environment-variables) file), and instantiate the Storage class as follows:

```
const {Storage} = require('@google-cloud/storage');
const storage = new Storage({
    projectId: project_id
    credentials: {
        client_email,
        private_key,
    }
});
```

Note that `projectId` is the only field name that is camelCase.

I tested it with the [getBuckets](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest/Storage.html#getBuckets) example, and voila! Successful API call ðŸŽ‰.

Tested with `Node.js 14.15.0` and `@google-cloud/storage@5.5.0`.
