## What is Twetch?

[Twetch](https://twetch.app) is a decentralized social media platform built on Bitcoin SV. Launched in 2019, Twetch looks and feels just like Twitter, with some important differences that make it a compelling alternative.

## What is Bitcoin SV?

[Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/) (BSV) is the blockchain and currency used in Twetch to interact with other users.

When you pay (or get paid, as you'll soon find out) on Twetch, you are transacting in BSV under the hood, though from a user perspective it looks like you're dealing with dollars and cents (or whatever your local currency is). In other words, it uses the exchange rate to display amounts in your local currency to make it more intuitive.

Bitcoin SV is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whose primary differentiator is an unlimited block size. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) have fixed block size limits (1MB and 32MB respectively), Bitcoin SV (BSV) removes the limit entirely, leaving the decision to individual miners. This enables low-fee microtransactions and makes it practical to host data on-chain, as we shall see below when we learn how Twetch works.

The existence of different forks/versions of Bitcoin is the result of civil wars between users of bitcoin who disagree on what the protocol rules should be.

In my opinion, all forks of bitcoin are bitcoin and it is wise to keep ownership parity across all bitcoin forks (BTC, BCH, BSV). Nobody knows for sure which will succeed or fail.

## How is Twetch different from Twitter?

### Posts live forever on the blockchain

Posts on Twetch are created as transactions on the BSV blockchain which means they are public, timestamped, and immutable, meaning they cannot be altered. 

Although posts exist on the blockchain forever, Twetch is essentially just a "window" to view the data. This means that hypothetically Twetch could choose to hide posts.

Unlike Twitter, where only Twitter has the latest up-to-date copy of all its user data, Twetch pulls all its users data from the blockchain. 

### Pay-to-post and earn money when users engage with your content

Posting on Twetch is not free because creating a Bitcoin transaction
Any time another user interacts with your content, you earn a commission.

- Creating a post costs 2¢
- Liking a post costs 10¢
- Branching (the equivalent of Retweeting) costs 3¢
- Following a user costs 10¢
- Someone mentions you (?)

Twetch earns a small (~10%) commission on the user-to-user interactions, while the other 90% goes to the user.

### User-funded features

Because posts are transactions, there is a small fee

### Encrypted chat

- It has an encrypted chat feature so 

(insert table comparison of Twetch vs Twitter)

Since all posts are public on the blockchain, the Twetch app itself is just a "window" into the blockchain and has some additional functionalities built on top of the "base layer" of public posts.

Some members of the Twetch team are intentional trolls. They threaten to ban people from the platform. They post memes. They taunt Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But there is a subtle signal they are sending by doing this sort of thing. Even if you develop a distaste for them, or don't trust them, the beauty is that you can fork their project at any time by leveraging the data that is on the blockchain. In other words, if the Twetch community decided that the Twetch founders were being toxic, nobody can stop you from creating your own version of Twetch that doesn't engage in these types of toxic practices. In other words, Twetch is anti-fragile because unlike Twitter, all the data is public.

### Your @username is a number and can't be changed

But you can change your display name anytime, and people will be able to search for your display name when they type '@'.

Your number is simply determined by incrementing from the current number of existing Twetch users. If there are 20,000 users when you sign up, your u/ number will be @20001.

This means there is a little "street cred" bonus for early adopters who have a low u/ number.

Your permanent username is incremental based on the number of Twetch users that existed before you signed up. I'm @4652 which means I was the 4,652nd person to sign up.
- Although your u/ name is permanent, you can set a display name just like Twitter

## How to sign up

Twetch is currently invite only, but there are ways you can get in. Currently on [Twetch's Twitter page](https://twitter.com/twetchapp) the website in the profile is a link to an invite. Existing users can invite new users, and have some extra invites. <a href={links.myTwitter}>DM me on Twitter</a> if you need one. As a last resort, you can sign up on the public waitlist on their website, [twetch.app](https://twetch.app).

Signing up is pretty straightforward using the invite link. It's basically a two-step process:
1. Create and fund a supported BSV wallet (MoneyButton, RelayX, DotWallet)
2. Accept your invite and link your Twetch account to your wallet account
3. (Optional) Follow me! I'm [@4652](https://twetch.app/u/4652) on Twetch.

## Memes

The Twetch and BSV community are relatively small right now, so a lot of the memes being posted are Bitcoin related. Here are some to be on the lookout for:

- Craig Wright 

## Meet The Founders

Twetch is operated by a dissident team of Bitcoin SV enthusiasts. Headed by Josh Petty, CEO and self-proclaimed "Meme Theory PhD", whose online persona is a Frog by the name of Elon Moist, they have a modest sized team working on the app.

Some of the early team members include:
