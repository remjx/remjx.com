## What is Twetch?

[Twetch](https://twetch.app) is a social media platform built on Bitcoin SV. Launched in 2019, Twetch looks and feels just like Twitter, with some important differences that make it a compelling alternative.

## What is Bitcoin SV?

If you're not familiar with [Bitcoin SV](https://bitcoinsv.io/), it is a [hard fork](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/h/hard-fork.asp) of [Bitcoin](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf) whose main differentiator is the unlimited block size which enables low fees, on-chain scaling, and microtransactions. Whereas Bitcoin (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH) set block size limits (1MB and 32MB respectively), Bitcoin SV (BSV) removes the limit entirely, leaving that decision to each individual miner.

The creation of these different versions of bitcon (forks) is the result of a civil war where users of bitcoin disagree on what the protocol rules should be. In my opinion, all forks of bitcoin are bitcoin and it is wise to keep ownership parity across all bitcoin forks instead of just choosing to own one since nobody knows for sure which will fail or succeed.

## How is Twetch different from Twitter?

### Posts live forever on the blockchain

Posts on Twetch are created as transactions on the BSV blockchain which means they are public, timestamped, and immutable, meaning they cannot be altered. 

Although posts exist on the blockchain forever, Twetch is essentially just a "window" to view the data. This means that hypothetically Twetch could choose to hide posts.

Unlike Twitter, where only Twitter has the latest up-to-date copy of all its user data, Twetch pulls all its users data from the blockchain. 

### Pay-to-post and earn money when users engage with your content

Posting on Twetch is not free because creating a Bitcoin transaction
Any time another user interacts with your content, you earn a commission.

- Creating a post costs 2¢
- Liking a post costs 10¢
- Branching (the equivalent of Retweeting) costs 3¢
- Following a user costs 10¢

Twetch earns a small (~10%) commission on the user-to-user interactions, while the other 90% goes to the user.

### User-funded features

Because posts are transactions, there is a small fee

### Encrypted chat

(insert table comparison of Twetch vs Twitter)

Since all posts are public on the blockchain, the Twetch app itself is just a "window" into the blockchain and has some additional functionalities built on top of the "base layer" of public posts.

Some members of the Twetch team are intentional trolls. They threaten to ban people from the platform. They post memes. They taunt Jack Dorsey of Twitter. But there is a subtle signal they are sending by doing this sort of thing. Even if you develop a distaste for them, or don't trust them, the beauty is that you can fork their project at any time by leveraging the data that is on the blockchain. In other words, if the Twetch community decided that the Twetch founders were being toxic, nobody can stop you from creating your own version of Twetch that doesn't engage in these types of toxic practices. In other words, Twetch is anti-fragile because unlike Twitter, all the data is public.

### Your username is a number

- Your permanent username is incremental based on the number of Twetch users that existed before you signed up. I'm @4652 which means I was the 4,652nd person to sign up.
- Although your u/ name is permanent, you can set a display name just like Twitter

## How to sign up

Note: Twetch is currently invite only, but they also have a public waitlist you can sign up for. I have some extra invites, so <a href={links.myTwitter}>send me a DM on Twitter</a> if you need one.

- Create and fund a supported BSV wallet (MoneyButton, RelayX, DotWallet)
- Accept your invite and link your Twetch account to your wallet account
- Get Twetchin'!

## Meet The Founders

Twetch is operated by a dissident team of provocateurs headed by Josh Petty, CEO and self-proclaimed "Meme Theory PhD", whose online persona is a Frog by the name of Elon Moist.
